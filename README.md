This documents some information on connecting the Elegoo 8-Channel Relay Module to a Raspberry Pi.

The guide can be found here - [Elegoo 8-Channel Relay and the Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/BandedHawk/eleego-and-raspberry-pi/blob/main/elegoo-and-raspberry-pi.md). It was written because the information on interfacing the two is not clear for novices to electronics and GPIO coding.
